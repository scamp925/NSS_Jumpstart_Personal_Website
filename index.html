        <h1>Nice to meet you!</h1>
        <p>My name is Sariah Campopiano. I have officially started my first real steps to becoming a web developer. How,
            you may ask, did I even find this path where I would be putting myself through learning the new world of web
            development? Well, I am glad you asked. It all started with a worldwide pandemic. You know the one:
            COVID-19. My husband and I were living in Italy celebrating the news of our first pregnancy when our world
            shutdown. With a lockdown, we couldn't go to the schools where we taught English. We lost many hours of
            work. Luckily, there were some students and classes still willing to learn English over Skype or Zoom. These
            students and classes were the only source of money we had. I'll save you the rest of the sob story and move
            right to the brighter side of things. We ended up moving back to the United States, had our baby girl in
            Nashville, Tennessee, and my husband started his bootcamp at Nashville Software School. In between diaper
            changes, feedings and taking care of all the other necessary things for our daughter, my husband and I would
            take walks and he would talk code. Talking the new concepts he learned in class out loud helped him better
            understand them. In turn, I was learning a bit about code myself. I was actually following along! He graduated
            6 months later then started his first job a month after that! Our lives have completely changed for the
            better because my husband decided to take a chance with himself and learn something new to him as well. Now
            it is my turn. My husband planted the seed of coding as we walked around the block all those nights ago. I
            have now completed my first real introduction to web development and coding. I am ready for my next step on my
            web development journey. Here I come, Bootcamp! </p>

                <p class="card-text">I love to read! I have always enjoyed the feeling of a book in my hands, but
                    recently I have found myself enjoying audiobooks as well! Some of my favorites are: Harry Potter by
                    J.K. Rowling, The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern, The
                    Nightingale by Kristin Hannah, and Tell Me Lies by J.P. Pomare.</p>

            <div class="card-body">
                <p class="card-text">I love to travel! I spent most of my life moving across
                    the United States as my father's job frequently changed locations. If his company said he needed to
                    move, we went. Some of the fondest places I have lived are Colorado, Ohio and Maryland. I have
                    also traveled in my adult life. My husband and I moved to Turin, Italy for a year and a half in
                    2019. We loved our Italian "Dolce Vita"! The picture above is me in the Alps. The city of Turin is planted
                    right by the Alps. A beautiful place to live.</p>

            <div class="card-body">
                <p class="card-text">Yes, I am one of those people who loves to plan! A birthday party, the next travel
                    desination, or dreaming about the future - you name it and I want to help plan it! Now, planning is
                    just half of the fun. I come up with goals and try to stick to them. To-do lists are key! The big
                    pay off is when all of your hard work comes together in the end, especially if you are planning
                    something for someone else. The look of surprise or delight is priceless.</p>
