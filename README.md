## Bonus challenge instructions

Instructions
Create a new HTML file in your pages directory called "visited-places.html"
Create a nav bar link to this new page from your index.html
Create a new JS file called "get-places.js"
Link your JS file to your "visited-places.html"
In your HTML
Include a single button.
Give the button an ID of "see-places".
Create an empty div element that comes after the button.
Give the div element an id of "output-places".

In your JS
Create an array of image links for places you've been. (A great source of images is Google Destinations).
Create an array of the names of those places that you created in the step above.
Create an event listener on the see-places button.
The event listener should call a function populatePlaces. This function should loop through the arrays and create "cards" with the image and the title. You should give each of these cards a class so you can style them.
The function should output all of these cards to the output-places div.
Bonus: The function hide the see-places button.

STYLE! Style the cards in a way that looks pretty.
